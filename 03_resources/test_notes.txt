Challenge notes
Understanding the application + scenarios 


FUNCTIONALITIES AND EXPECTATIONS:

scenarios:
1. filename in original > file name in droplist > *file is dropped so will not appear in finals* 
2. filename in original > file name in allowlist > *file will appear in finals* 
3. filename in original > file name in allowlist > filename in updates > *file from updates appears in finals*
4. filename in original > file name in droplist > filename in updates > *file from updates appears in finals*
5. filename not in original > file name in droplist (has no effect tho) > filename in updates > *file from updates appears in finals*
6. file name in original > different file name in droplist > *file from original appears in finals*
7. file name in original > different file name in allowlist > *file from original appears in finals*
8. file name in original > no allowlist or droplist > *error*
9. no allowlist or droplist > filename in updated > *error*
10. filename in original > no allowlist or droplist > filename in updated > *error*
11. filename in original > different name in allowlist or droplist > filename in updated > *error*





Possible errors

- file name in neither allow list or drop list
- folders for original or updates not found
- documents not in correct format
- more than one files? what are the expectations\
- allowed to be in finals if its not in either allow or drop??
- formatting of the allow/droplist file 



Test cases/Exploratory notes

source into venv first - install Faker
then run test_document_updater.py to get the files generated
then run document_updater.py to get the program to run - THIS IS WHERE YOU VERIFY RESULTS


cannot perform if both drop list and allow list are present
has to follow format or will give error code
no message to say that original has been dropped 



Areas to test - 
- name of file
- data in file (name and address, allowdroplist)
- folders present/or not (original, updates)
- folders content (different files)
- allowlist drop list present
- in/valid data in files
- name different to the file name
