Challenge notes
Understanding the application + scenarios 


FUNCTIONALITIES AND EXPECTATIONS:


1. filename in original > file name in droplist > *file is dropped so will not appear in finals* 
2. filename in original > file name in allowlist > *file will appear in finals* 
3. filename in original > file name in allowlist > filename in updates > *file from updates appears in finals*
4. filename in original > file name in droplist > filename in updates > *file from updates appears in finals*
5. filename not in original > file name in droplist (has no effect tho) > filename in updates > *file from updates appears in finals*
6. file name in original > different file name in droplist > *file from original appears in finals*
7. file name in original > different file name in allowlist > *file from original appears in finals*




Possible errors

1. file name in neither allow list or drop list
2. folders for original or updates not found
3. documents not in correct format
4. more than one files? what are the expectations\
5. allow 

Building python scripts

* had to add droplist file? is it always meant to be entered manually (maybe code to interchange ) 
* built 4 methods 
    * adding file to originals
    * adding file to updates
    * adding file to droplist
    * adding file to allow list
* need:
    * putting in data 




Test cases/Exploratory notes

cannot perform if both drop list and allow list are present
has to follow format or will give error code
